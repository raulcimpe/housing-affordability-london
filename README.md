This repository contains a final-year project developed at **London South Bank University (LSBU)**.  
It investigates to what extent **key public sector workers in London** â€” teachers, NHS nurses, and TfL bus drivers â€” are excluded from **affordable home ownership** between **2010 and 2025**.

> **Data policy (BYOD):** This repository does **not** include datasets or the final written report.  
> Bring Your Own Data: instructions below show how to run the notebook with your own local copies of the public sources.

## ðŸ”Ž Introduction
Affordability pressures in global cities can displace essential workers and strain public services.  
This project applies recognised metrics â€” primarily the **House Price to Income Ratio (HPIR)** and related affordability ratios â€” across **32 London boroughs** and key worker groups to quantify the affordability gap.

The analysis is implemented in **Python (Google Colab / local)** and visualised with **Tableau Public**.

---

## ðŸ§­ Method (CRISP-DM)
1. **Business Understanding** â€“ Define the affordability question for key workers.  
2. **Data Understanding** â€“ Explore official sources (ONS, DfE, NHS Pay, TfL).  
3. **Data Preparation** â€“ Clean, align, and reshape to analysis-ready formats (performed locally).  
4. **Modeling / Calculation** â€“ HPIR, affordability ratios/thresholds, borough comparisons.  
5. **Evaluation** â€“ Temporal and spatial interpretation; sensitivity checks.  
6. **Deployment** â€“ Interactive dashboards on Tableau Public; notebook for reproducibility (BYOD).

## ðŸ’» Reproducibility (BYOD: no datasets in repo)
This project ships **no data**. To run locally or in Colab:

1. **Download public datasets** from the original sources (e.g., ONS House Price Index, DfE teachersâ€™ pay, NHS Agenda for Change, TfL pay).  
2. Place files in a local directory of your choice (kept **outside** the repository).  
3. Open `notebooks/london_housing_final.ipynb` and set a data directory variable:

```python
import os

# Detect Colab vs local
IN_COLAB = "google.colab" in str(getattr(__import__("sys"), "modules", {}))
if IN_COLAB:
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount("/content/drive")
    DATA_DIR = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Final Project 2025"
else:
    # Set via environment variable or edit this path
    DATA_DIR = os.environ.get("DATA_DIR", r"C:\path\to\your\datasets")

# Example usage:
price_index_path = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "price_index.xlsx")
teachers_path    = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "teachers_pay.csv")
# ... add remaining files you use locally
